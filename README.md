=========================================================================

            

Create a weekly Azure Automation update deployment for one or more VMs in a resource group. It assumes that the VM's are already onboarded to Update Management in the automation account that this runbook runs in. You will need to modify the specific
 deployment schedule as necessary as it is currently hardcoded within the runbook.


You can onboard additional Azure VMs by using the process described on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
